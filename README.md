# Talk
This is mainly an experiment to see whether creating something similar to what [tolk](https://github.com/dkager/tolk) was would be worth it.  
The API is expected to break frequently for now, so use at your own risk, if you do.
## How does it work?
Talk makes use of a single concept, `Driver` which is a trait used to implement generic abstractions over screenreaders.
You may find some examples in the [examples](https://github.com/pauliyobo/talk/blob/master/examples) folder
